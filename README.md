# Agent Based Model - Virus Transmission Simulation

This model explores virus transmission in a variety of conditions and environments. It focuses on how making assumptions about agent interactions can have a significant impact on the model's outcomes.

Infectious disease transmission patterns are hypothesised to result from the interaction between local interactions amongst people when ABM is employed for epidemic modelling. Each person is modelled as an agent with an internal state that depicts the condition of their infectious disease at any given time. Individuals interact with one another, i.e., can infect or be infected, when they migrate to the same location at the same time, and infectious disease transmission rates, as well as how close they are (if they are in crowded places).
